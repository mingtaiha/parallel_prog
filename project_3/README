This is the readme for Project 3 of Parallel & Distributed Programming

We assume that the environment in which you compile this code support nvcc, g++, and gcc compilers

For Problem 1:
    1) Go to the folder `part1`
    2) run `make`
    3) Run the code using the following command:
        ./problem1 <size_of_array> <threads_per_block>

        ** The inputs are assumed to be positive integers


For Problem 2:
    1) Go to the folder `part2`
    2) run `make`
    3) Run the code using the following command:
        ./problem2 <num_rows_A> <num_cols_A> <num_rows_B> <num_cols_B>

        ** All inputs are assumed to be positive integers, and num_cols_A == num_rows_B
