This is the readme for Project 3 of Parallel & Distributed Programming

We assume that the environment in which you compile this code support nvcc, g++, and gcc compilers

For Problem 1:
    1) Go to the folder `part1`
    2) run `make`
    3) Run the code using the following command:
        ./problem1 <size_of_array> <threads_per_block>

        ** The inputs are assumed to be positive integers
        ** Sample outputs can be found in the `part1` directory. Output for EC2 g2.2xlarge and
            Sandbox 8 on ORBIT can be found in `problem1_output_ec2` and problem1_output_orbit-sb8`,
            respectively.

For Problem 2:
    1) Go to the folder `part2`
    2) run `make`
    3) Run the code using the following command:
        ./problem2 <num_rows_A> <num_cols_A> <num_rows_B> <num_cols_B>

        ** All inputs are assumed to be positive integers, and num_cols_A == num_rows_B
        ** Sample outputs can be found in the `part2` directory. Output for EC2 g2.2xlarge and
            Sandbox 8 on ORBIT can be found in `problem2_output_ec2` and problem2_output_orbit-sb8`,
            respectively.
 
 For Problem 3
    1) Go to the folder 'part3'
    2) Using Microsoft Visual Studio, create new project and add "bfsCuda.cu" to the project
    3) Build the project in Visual Studio
    4) Run without debugger
